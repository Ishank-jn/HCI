"AccomplLife" is a goal setting and management application. The idea behind AccompLife is to improve:

1. Efficiency: By integrating to-do list, calendars and reminder into single platform, thus, reducing users' 
need to navigate multiple platforms. 

2. Accessibility: Most of the tasks can be completed in 3-4 clicks thereby reducing user effort, thus, 
focus has been on learnability of the app.

3. Approachability: The app allows user to set their own routine and allows dynamic re-prioritization of 
goals. Moreover, it provides both vocal and text input methods.
